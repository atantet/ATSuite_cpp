\item Create a directory A\+T\+Suite in your favorite include directory \$\+I\+N\+C\+L\+U\+DE.
\item Copy the $\ast$.hpp files to \$\+I\+N\+C\+L\+U\+DE/\+A\+T\+Suite/.
\item Include these files in your C++ codes. For example, in order to include the matrix manipulation functions in atmatrix.\+hpp, add \char`\"{}\#include $<$\+A\+T\+Suite/atmatrix.\+hpp$>$\char`\"{} in your C++ file.
